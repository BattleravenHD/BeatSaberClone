â€‹This is a solo project done during my second year at the University of Canterbury in which the brief was to create a VR Rhythm game.
This Project uses audio analysis to auto generate the note block timing and randomly using a direction formula to create smooth(ish) flow of gameplay. It also uses this to generate obstacles to avoid during dead zones of songs.
